# AssembleTwoTypesOfReads.py
assemble two types of reads using the De Bruijn graph representation and the Eulerian path to obtain the original sequence from that representation.

assemble two types of reads using the DeBruijn graph representation and the Eulerian path to obtain the
original sequence from that representation.

First type of reads : Short reads with the same size
Second type of reads : Pair-reads with a known distance between them
